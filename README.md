# Developers Mountain

Our project showcases the **ranks of developers** based on their **GitHub skills** and **data structure & algorithm (DSA) proficiency**.

---

###  The Reason

With the rising concern of **AI impacting software jobs** and **over 3 million developers in India alone**, it‚Äôs becoming increasingly difficult for companies to identify candidates who are both **practically skilled** and **analytically strong**.

That‚Äôs where our product comes in. üí°

---

###  How It Exactly Works

- Developers can **sign up** on our platform using their **GitHub accounts**.
- We analyze their **recent GitHub activity** ‚Äî currently focusing on their **last five merged pull requests** to evaluate:
  - Code quality
  - Commit history
  - Other relevant parameters

> ‚ö†Ô∏è _Note: We only consider merged PRs to optimize API usage, since we are currently on the free tier._

- Alongside GitHub analysis, we also assess the developer‚Äôs **DSA skills** by reviewing:
  - Number of problems solved
  - Difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard)

---

### Ranking System

- A score is generated for both **GitHub contributions** and **DSA performance**.
- These scores are **combined** to generate an **overall developer ranking**.

---

###  Impact

- Helps **developers** understand their standing.
- Enables **companies** to identify **top talent** more effectively.

Stay tuned ‚Äî this is just the beginning!
